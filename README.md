## Project Structure:

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning:
#### The dataset is imported using Pandas, and potential issues like missing values and data types are addressed.
#### Unnecessary columns are dropped, and specific data types are adjusted for better analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
#### The exploratory data analysis involves various visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
#### Grouping data is done using groupby to summarize and visualize information based on specific columns.
#### Other visualizations include pie charts, histograms, barplot and scatter plots to explore different aspects of the data.

### 3. Business Insights:
